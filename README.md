## Overview

**SkillSync** is a web application designed to solve the common problem of unbalanced project teams in academic settings. Instead of forming teams based on existing friendships (which often leads to skill gaps), SkillSync matches students based on:

- **Complementary technical skills** - Find partners who have what you lack
- **Schedule compatibility** - Ensure partners can actually meet
- **Work style preferences** - Match morning people with morning people

### The Problem

Students often form project teams with friends, leading to scenarios like three frontend developers with no one for backend, team members with incompatible schedules, and skill overlap causing role conflicts.

### The Solution

SkillSync provides skill gap analysis, availability overlap visualization, and intelligent matching to build balanced, effective project teams.
